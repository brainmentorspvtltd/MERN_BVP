Steps 
To get the data from the network and render on component
a) Maintain the URL / EndPoint in .env File , and Key must be start with REACT_APP Prefix 
Note : Whenever we change in the .env file we need to restart the application.
Stop by Pressing Ctrl + C in Terminal and then start again by npm start.

b) Call the API By Using axios , we maintain in API_CLIENT.js ,and it returns promise.

c) We need to get the data in Component, Either on Some Event or either when component is Mount.
If Data need in Component Mount Phase, then use useEffect Hook.
So UseEffect hook get the data from the API_CLIENT
You get the promise and get the data in then and set in state.

d) When data is set in state component will re-render.
So we iterate the data using map and print it.
